# Files
Below is a list of files in this directory. The hidden files are there to trigger other scripts, since commands given by scheduler.py tell the target to execute a file, not a command. These will be labeled with the file they are designed to trigger.
## .email.sh (Hidden)
agents/emailSender.py

## .freenas.sh (Hidden)
netBuilder/FreeNAS/freeNAS.py
