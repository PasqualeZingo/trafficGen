# Usage
type

    ./addDisk.sh <project_name> <node_name> <disk_name>
to copy the disk of the chosen node from the chosen project into your gns3/images/QEMU file and rename it to disk_name.

# Troubleshooting
You may need to modify the getdisk.sh script to work on your environment. In the script there is a line with instructions on what to change.
