# trafficGen

## Create session
To create a network, clone this repo and checkout the mono branch. Create a project titled "testtest". type "python3 example-net.py". If there are any nodes within the project before running the script, they will be deleted. This may takes some time. When the program is done deleting nodes, it will print the message "testtest has been cleared of all nodes!" NOTE: The script has occasinally been known to crash the gns3 GUI of those viewing the project, which will often lead to the script crashing as well, as if everyone viewing the project disconnects, gns3 will close the project while the script is running. If the script is successful, four traffic_gen_boxes, one email server, a print server, a NAT cloud, a pfsense router, and a switch will appear. The traffic_gen_boxes, print server, and email server will be connected to the switch, along with the router's em1 port. The router's em0 port will connect to the NAT cloud. All the nodes will be started automatically. Once the router is done booting (the progress of this can be checked by right-clicking the router node and clicking 'console'), the network will be ready to recieve instructions from the scheduler.py script within the master branch.
