This is a mono repo containing everything needed to operate and develop on the virtualized network within brass.
## Prereqs
### VMWare Workstation
The UD College of Engineering provides a number of different softwares through UDeploy. Our development VM runs on VMware Workstation which can be downloaded from [UDeploy here](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/vmware-for-university-of-delaware/)


### UD VPN
In order to connect to brass, you need to be connected to the UD network. [The UD AnyConnect VPN](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/anyconnect-vpn/) can be found here. If you haven't already, the UD VPN also requires a second password, which is generated through google authenticator. You can set that up by following the instructions layed out on this [webpage](https://services.udel.edu/TDClient/32/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=4)


### IDS-ML VM
Our VM image is hosted on google drive which can be downloaded here. #TODO insert vm image link
